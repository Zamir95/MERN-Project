        amazing. She had already written it in her head and each time she thought about 
        it she grinned from ear to ear knowing how wonderful it would be. She could 
        imagine the accolades coming in and the praise she would receive for creating such 
        a wonderful piece. She was therefore extremely frustrated when she actually sat 
        down to write the short story and the story that was so beautiful inside her 
        head refused to come out that way on paper.</p>

        -see situation with the final results no longer in her control. That didn't 
        stop her from trying to control the situation. She demanded that things be done 
        as she desperately tried to control what couldn't be. "Are you getting my 
        texts???" she texted to him. He glanced at it and chuckled under his breath. Of 
        course he was getting them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be 
        able to answer? He put the phone down and continued on his project. He was ignoring 
        her texts and he planned to continue to do so.</p>
